        <div class="row">
            <div class="container content-holder">
                <p class="sub-heading">What is TDW?</p>
                <p>TDW is an open initiative that is aimed to provide employees and organizations with ideas to create a more engaging and fair workplace. We believe that many organizations across the world do not treat employees with the respect they deserve and practice policies and rituals that are decades old. We want to break it through our fictional employee handbook and 100s of examples. </p>
                <p class="sub-heading">What is your vision, aka why do you exist in the world?</p>
                <p>TDW aims to provide organizations and employees alike with insights which can be implemented at various organizations across the world in order to make the employees across the world happy with their orgnizations.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">What is the TDW handbook?</p>
                <p>The TDW Handbook is the employee handbook of a fictional company called "The Dream Workplace" aka TDW. No one except the Wakandans know what the TDW does. Some say that they are a super-secret organization who are the representatives of extra-terrestrial beings. Some others say that the TDW is a figment of some disgruntled imagination. But, they apparently have a workforce that is super-delighted. And organization leaders apparently want to know the secret recipe.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">What does the TDW blog include?</p>
                <p>The TDW blog includes not just the TDW handbook, but also 100s of examples we have gathered from across several websites and other resources - some of them that are behind a paywall. We want you to read them and probably discuss with your HR in seeing how you can implement them in your organization.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">I see a lot of ads in TDW. Why?</p>
                <p>We are underpaid, overworked, and are not happy with that. &#128540;. Jokes apart, we believe that most of the resources across the world should not be behind a paywall. It goes against the principles of why the Internet was built. And we appreciate organizations such as McKinsey which do not put up a paywall for their insights. But, we also need money - to go for an international trip, or to buy the latest Playstation in town, or to just make life better. Hence, we rely on ads.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">I do not see an option to subscribe. Why?</p>
                <p>Look at your inbox. It is flooded with emails and newsletters that are subscribing for your attention. We don't want to get into that list. We know that if you like our articles, you will come and visit our site. And share it with your colleagues. Yeah, it is also tough to build and maintain a subscriber list. You know, GDPR et all. So sorry subscriber. We love you, but not enough to take your email ID and store it safely in an Alaskan warehouse.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">I do not think all these policies are pratical. What should I do?</p>
                <p>We know. And we do not expect an organization to follow everything that TDW does. Remember, TDW is Wakandan. On a serious note, the idea is not to implement everything, but to get inspired and take the essence of the idea. For example, it may not always be easy or pratical a 4-day work week across all industries, but the fundamental idea is to offer employees with more flexibility and more time to spend for their personal life. And we would love if organizations understand these fundamental ideas that are behind each of these policies and implement them in their workplaces.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">All of the policies in the TDW document cost a lot of money. Isn't it?</p>
                <p>Again - We know. But, trust us - it is not about the money. A more engaged workforce will produce better results and better results will only improve profits, a share of which, we belive, should be given to employees. Yeah, it is a chicken and egg story, but in some cases, the benefits will have to come first.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Does this happen anywhere?</p>
                <p>All of these are taken from real world examples. Even though people may call the The Dream Workplace as fictional, the policies of the TDW document are not fictional. We will soon update a list of our inspirations and you can go to their careers page to learn more. Or you can read more from your examples page <a href="examples.html">here</a>.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Can we use the TDW document in our organization?</p>
                <p>Absolutely yes. We are not going to put any copyright to it. In case you love our efforts, you can buy us a coffee <a href="coffee.html">here</a>. We thank you for that. And let us continue to inspire by sharing with more organizations.</p>
