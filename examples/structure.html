As a result they gained unexpected yet highly detailed information about features they should prioritize, which had all been generated by their employees. This ultimately resulted in rethinking product development priorities and also generated savings in R&D.</p>

As Basecamp says, 'For over 10 years, we didn’t have a handbook. In those 10 years, when a new person joined the company, they were expected to figure things out for themselves. But when we grew from a company of 10, 20, 30 employees to a company of over 50, our “introduction by immersion” style stopped working. New hires felt lost and isolated, and their first weeks or even months on the job were stressful because of it. And hence they built a guide that wil help in understanding Basecamp.'</p>

                    <p class="d-inline"><b>Drift</b> has recently started a new initiative called Random Lunch with DC (no agenda, DC stands for its CEO - David Cancel). It’s an extremely simple idea but one that has the power to drive a high level of employee engagement at the Boston company; an odd number of people are randomly selected from different parts of the company to have lunch with DC. There is no agenda for each lunch, but the goal of the initiative is to help everyone get to know one another, to keep communication walls from building up, gain insight on culture and product ideas, and most importantly to help DC identify choke points within the organisation, which have the power to disengage and switch people off. Each lunch will feature a variety of rookies and vets, as well as a mix of people from different functions, and if you’re wondering why each lunch will have an odd number of people, it’s simply to stop people pairing up.</p>
