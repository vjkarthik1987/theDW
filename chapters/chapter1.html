        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6 text-start navigator">
                <a href="../chapters/chapter0.html">Previous</a>
            </div>

            </div>
            <div class="content-holder">
                <p>You, the employee of TDW, are TDW. Every time that you work for TDW, you are representing TDW, and every work that you do at TDW is a representation of you. Every time that you interact with a customer, or every time that you interact with a co-worker, or one of our partners, TDW becomes you. The person at the other end of the conversation sees TDW in you and expects you to follow the beliefs that TDW stands for. They see TDW in you. We would love you to keep that in mind, always if possible (Yeah, sometimes we know it gets crazy, but try to do it as far as possible).</p>
                <p>This also means that every decision TDW makes and every action TDW takes can have and will have an impact on you - direct or otherwise, and everyone at TDW understands this.</p>
                <p>Hence, we at TDW want to make clear two things - </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>You are going to be the focal point of TDW. And like you, everyone else at TDW including the people who wrote this document is the focal point at TDW. Every decision we make or do not make, and every action we take or do not take, will be keeping this in mind. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>We expect you also to keep everyone at TDW, and TDW itself in a good part of your mind and consciousness, and whenever you do for the time you are employed with TDW, do so keeping the best interests of TDW in mind. We trust you do that.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>So, if you are the focal point at TDW, where does that put the customer? Let us say that our customers are important and probably the only reason for the money we get. But we believe that if we put you at the centre, everything else, including the customer relationships and our growth will take care of itself.</p>
                <p>Let us put it this way - for us, customer delight (and not satisfaction) is a priority (we do not believe in priorities) and we are willing to go to any extent, provided it is the right way, to ensure customer delight. But, we do not want to achieve customer delight at the cost of your happiness.</p>
                <p>Being a part of TDW is not supposed to overwhelm you, and we expect you to have far more important things in your life than us. In case it does overwhelming, please do our CEO or your team leader know - and we assure you we will look out for you.
                </p>
                <p>Before we go ahead, let us take one more chance to welcome you - even if it is your first day, or even if you are part of the TDW mythology and have been with us forever. Thank you for being part of TDW. And we hope we do not disappoint you.</p>
                <p><span class="fw-bold">PS:</span> We do not use the word ‘family’ within TDW. That is cringe. Family is what you have in and around your home. Yeah, some of us at TDW can be part of your family at some point in your life, or already are. But we believe that ‘family’ is not a word that should be used in workplaces. RIP - Family feeling at Workplace.</p>
