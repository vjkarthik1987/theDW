                <p>We believe that it is our accountability to help you perform your goals and our performance enablement process is meant to be just that.</p>
                <p>Let us explain in simple terms our performance enablement process</p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li>
                        <p>We like many other companies follow the OKR model for performance enablement. In case you are not aware of OKR, please click this <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/">link</a> or buy any book on OKRs. The cost of the book is on us.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>At the start of the calendar year, based on the annual goals of your team, you set your OKRs for the current quarter. You will have to get input from your team leader and if both of you cannot reach an agreement, we will get the function leader to be involved. Ultimately, even though your OKRs are owned by you, your team leader will also have a say in it since we are all in it for the team.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you do not have your OKRs updated after the agreed date, your email accounts will be frozen and you will not be able to work. We take the OKR management process seriously and hence we follow drastic and sometimes, draconian measures, but the benefits are worth the pain.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>You are expected to update the status of your OKRs every month, and if you and your team leader agree to a shorter frequency, please do so. But please do not fail to update your OKRs by the indicated dates.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>You will have a conversation with your team leader by the end of every month which will cover three things - What did you do in this month?; What will you do the next month?; and What are the key learnings from this month? Unless there is something that is confidential in nature, these points are made available for the entire team to see and you will be able to see the points of your other team members.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>At the end of every quarter, you will be asked to file the status of your OKRs and you will have a conversation with your team leader to draft the next quarterâ€™s OKRs. You will also indicate your plans for the next quarter and find a point of alignment where everyone is comfortable. If you are not happy being involved in a certain project, you can opt-out after giving sufficient lead time for the team to look out for a replacement.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The focus of the quarterly conversation is more on what you can do in the future and less on past performance. We hope you follow this thumb rule. If there were mistakes, focus on corrections, and not on mistakes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>We trust you with the update that you give with respect to your OKRs. In case your team leader has a different perspective, he or she will let you know, but your word will be final.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Based on the quarterly OKR completion, your bonus will be paid out (we will cover that in a later section), but the current guideline is that if you achieve more than 70% of your OKRs for the quarter, you will get 100% of your bonus and if you achieve anywhere between 50% to 70%, you will get a proportionate amount of your bonus (currently it is 50% for achieving 50% of your OKRs, and 100% for achieving 70% of your OKRs, and the numbers in between are rated on a linear scale).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>At the end of every quarter, you will also be asked to rate your team leader and your peers (or your team) on certain parameters. This will be an anonymous survey and the feedback will be shared with the individual for his or her study and is not meant to be used for any performance discussion.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>We do not do any forced ranking, nor are there any performance brackets. We believe that people are not objects to be rated on a scale and be compared with each other.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>OKRs, however objective, also tend to bring up certain factors that are subjective, and we are OK with it. Not everything in life is measurable. We will take your word on what you say is the percentage of completion.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Performance discussions also tend to bring about a difficult part - performance improvement plans. This is inevitable if an individual does not perform as per the expectations of the TDW. But like many other organizations, we do not put the individual into a performance improvement plan straight away. We do not have a performance improvement process. We believe that a person does not perform because of the following three reasons - 1) He or she is not in the right role, 2) He or she has some issues that need to be handled (for eg. at the home, or with their health), or 3) He or she does not have the capability to perform any job in TDW. For the first two cases, we work with the individual for the next two quarters to find out the best way possible. It can either be a change of a team, or an extended period off, or any solution that may seem feasible. We believe that most people improve given a long rope. For the third case, we will provide a relaxation period where we will work together with the individual for the next two quarters, and if the performance is still an issue, we will help the individual find a new job through one of the hiring agencies we have a contract with and we will keep paying the individual a salary till he/she finds a new job or for a period of six months, whichever is earlier.</p>
