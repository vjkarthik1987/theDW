                <p>We do understand that TDW is not the only thing in your life - in fact, we do not mind if it ainâ€™t in the top three - you have your family, health, friends, and social life - and a lot of other things. And we know that you need time for all of this. Hence, we do not monitor the holidays that you take. In fact, you have unlimited paid time off - we do not mind as long as you are on top of your work. In case you are going to take a planned holiday, please tell your leader in advance so that the work can be planned accordingly.</p>
                <p>We also provide an option to completely disconnect from work in the last fortnight of the calendar year. Yes, some people will have to stay back so that we have a skeletal workforce, but for those of you who stay back - we will adjust the two-week vacation on a later date.</p>
                <p>We also do not categorize your vacation and leave into sick leave or other kinds of leave. In case you are not in the right state of health to work, please tell your leader. Just indicate that you are on a leave and put it on the system. </p>
                <p>Welcoming a new kid into your life is a special moment and we provide paid time off for one year for all new parents - male or female. You can also get paid time off for the last three months of your pregnancy - we want you to take care.</p>
                <p>We also understand the pain of losing someone from your life and we offer paid time off of up to six months for the same.</p>
                <p>Employees who complete five years are put on a mandatory one-month holiday and given a stipend (as per the employee policy updated on our internal site). This not only ensures that the employee is rejuvenated but also ensures that we do not create a dependency on an individual.</p>
                <p>Since we are a remote-first company, we do not track the time that you spent on each task and we believe this system will work on one single element - trust. And we always trust you to do the right thing.</p>
                <p>One more thing. Once you are part of TDW, you will often hear the term - effective employee count - or EEC. It is the effective number of employees who are actively working for TDW - it is the total number of employees minus the number of employees on leave plus the proportionate workforce calculated from the people who are on contract or are working through the gig model. Don't bother now. It is just a mathematical formula devised by our brilliant HR team.</p>
