                <p>As we pointed out, we are a remote-first company. But we do have an office, even though it is very small to accommodate everyone in our office.</p>
                <p>At the start of every quarter, every one of us has a choice to decide how we want to work - either completely from home, or completely from the office, or in a hybrid model. It is the right of each employee to decide their preferred choice of a working model, and we want to ensure that none of the leaders nor the team that the employee is working with influences the decision.
                </p>
                <p>One point to note - we have limited seating in our home office and hence the slots may run out soon. In case you want to work from the office or use a hybrid model, please book your slots in advance by making the choice in our online tool est the seating capacity runs out.
                </p>
                <p>Once the decision is made, we stick with you. If you have chosen the option to work remotely, you can work from anywhere. We trust you to manage the workflow and communication with your team even if you are several time zones away.
                </p>
                <p>You can review this decision every quarter.
                </p>
                <p>It is also important to note that we have employees across the world and each of us will have to respect the cultural differences and be cognizant of timezone differences as we work. Let us not hurt anyone and let us all try to accommodate. As we say - be calm, conscious, and considerate.</p>
                <p>We work four days a week - Monday to Thursday. And we do not prevent you from working on Friday, but we do not encourage that. And you do not get brownie points for working on weekends. Because we are a globally distributed workforce, we do not have a set model of working hours. But as a general guideline, you are supposed to work for 8 hours a day and the leaders plan by assuming that you are available for 8 hours a day.</p>
                <p>One more thing - even though you can be anywhere in the world, you will be tagged to one of our eight global locations. This is because of various regulatory practices. And you will be considered an employee of the location that you are tagged to - for all practical purposes.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">But what if you want to see us?</p>
                <p>That feeling is not new, and we do understand that you want to see the person whom you have been interacting with over a video call and see if he or she is for real. We do meet up at a central location for one week every year - an all-expenses paid trip by us. Every year, the modality changes, and this is a secret that we will tell you once you are part of TDW.</p>
