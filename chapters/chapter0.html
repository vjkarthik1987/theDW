                <p>Everyone is different, and similarly, every workplace is different. Some may be big, some small. Some may follow a disciplined approach, while some may follow an approach that is more laid back and free. But, it is not the difference that matters. It is the uniqueness that matters and needs to be celebrated. </p>
                <p>We, The Dream Workplace, are not prone to exception. We are different and unique. And like anything that is different and unique, it can get scary for first-time users.</p>
                <p>This policy handbook (well, technically, it has less of policies and is not really a handbook, but it is more of a propaganda machine for the vision of a few crazy individuals including people from HR) is meant to take away the fear of the new joiners and help them navigate the crazy world of The Dream Workplace. It is also meant to serve as a refresher course for those who have been with us for a really long time that those brain cells that stored the information about the way we work have gone kaput.
                </p>
                <p>We believe every workplace is an opportunity for an individual to learn new things, unlearn old things, and most importantly teach the organisations things that work and need change. A lot of us have been in The Dream Workplace for so long that we don’t know how the world works outside. We are literal ‘frogs in the well’. Come teach us.
                </p>
                <p>This handbook (yeah, let us keep calling this piece of work a handbook) contains how we work, what we expect from you, and more importantly what you can expect from us (including lots of food and a shiny new laptop).
                </p>
                <p>The source code for this handbook is on Github. If you want to want to suggest a new change, or just found out one of the many mistakes that the authors of this book have committed, go ahead and tell us on Github. If you happen to exist in a parallel world, where GitHub is not your cup of tea (or coffee or milk or whatever you prefer), go ahead and reach out to us here.
                </p>
                <p>One more thing (yeah, we are fans of Steve Jobs and could not resist the pun). Most employee handbooks start with a legal disclaimer and use a lot of legal language. We do not understand that, and we are sure most of you don’t either. So we are not going to use it. So, you will not find sentences like - This is an agreement between the ‘The Dream Workplace’, hereafter referred to as the company, and John Doe, hereafter referred to as the employee, are entering into which states that in case of an emergency, the company may not suvoir dire and the employee is expected to appear in front of the jury pro se and in extreme cases, the employment contract may be quashed without early notice from the side of the employer. We really don’t understand what that means, and hence we don’t want to write like that. Loaded words are off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, in line with the above sentence, you may find a lot of we and you on the following pages. We, in this context, are TDW, and you, in this context is, the employee, I am sure you would have got it, but we did not want to take a risk.
