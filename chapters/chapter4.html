            <div class="content-holder">
                <p>Okay, you have accepted the offer, and have locked in on a joining date - based on discussions between you and us. The day you accept the offer is technically the pseudo-first day for us when we start rolling the ball. While we may not create an email ID (an email subscription costs money and we don’t want to scare you away with our emails even before you join), a lot of things are set in motion once you sign on the dotted lines.</p>
                <p>You get a call from your leader in the next two days (unless he or she is on a vacation, in which case you are informed) where he or she will welcome you and share with this handbook (unless you have not come across it in the internet). A shiny little laptop and other gifts start shipping from our central headquarters and you will get a tracking ID for that. And most importantly, you will get a checklist of items that you need to complete by the time you join us - your bank details, copies of certain personal documents, and a host of legalities that need to be completed as per the country of the jurisdiction you are in. Trust us, we really don’t want to get most of this stuff, but in case we don’t one of the people sitting in the HR team may be put behind bars. Hence, please bear with us. We will also require a good-looking photo from you - not a mugshot - so that we can create an employee card for you, and also update it in our records. Please smile in the photo. And we don’t mind if you have your partner, baby, or even your pet in the photo. We really don’t mind. One more thing, you will also receive a list of phone numbers - of your buddy (who will be your guide and listening pot for the whole of the first year), of your immediate team members, and your leader and the function leader of your team. Please free to disturb them, and certainly do disturb your buddy.
                </p>
                <p>And after all the pain that we put you through once you decide to join, if you are still up for the challenge ahead, then you are welcome to TDW.
                </p>
                <p>We are a remote-first company (more on that later), but that simple statement dictates how you will have your first day. We do have an office where we are headquartered but we do not expect you to turn up at our office on the first day.
                </p>
                <p>Your first meeting will be with your team and your leader - a group meeting where you will be introduced to everyone. A quick 30-minute call. They would have seen your resume and they know about you. Probably some of them might be stalking you on social media also. But, we are sure that you would have spoken to most of your team. You will also get a short bio about each of your team members so that you know what surprises to expect.</p>
                <p>Your first meeting will be followed by a boring orientation (again) of how we work, how we execute, how we team up, and a lot of other boringly agonizing stuff. This will go on for the next two days. The cruel HR team might even put up a pop quiz, better be prepared for that. But let us give you a heads-up on some important things - the sessions on the first two days also include a working session on how to file for an expense claim and make a travel request or book a flight and a hotel - all important tools that you need.</p>
                <p>Be prepared for a hectic and meeting-heavy first three days. A lot of orientation sessions on each of the items covered in this book will be complemented by a team orientation session on how your team works, their current goals, and the OKRs of every single person in your team. You will also get to see a video from our CEO and a history class on the story of TDW. In case the schedules align, you will also have a meeting with our CEO.</p>
                <p>But your most important session in the first three days is none of the above we stated. It will be your session with your leader. Your leader will explain the expectations from you, and the nitty-gritty of your role as well as take you through the team rituals and working style. Your leader will also explain the team’s current objectives and how you fit into the overall jigsaw puzzle.</p>
                <p>After the first three days, you are a free bird. You will be on paid time off for the next seven working days - and it is during this time that you get to make a decision on whether you want to work with us or whether you want to ditch us. In case you decide to leave us during this period, we will not be sad or angry at you. We trust you to take a decision that is in your best interest. We also offer you a stipend for people who leave within this period. And hope that we meet again sometime in the future.</p>
                <p>After you come back from paid time off and be ready to start working, you will NOT be asked to start working immediately. We do not believe in the phrase hit the ground running. You will shadow someone who is in a role that is similar to the one that you are doing or closely similar to the one that you are going to do. In these two weeks, you will also definitely have a call with our CEO, and sometimes with our other leaders also. In these two weeks, you are also expected to do the following – set up a meeting with your team leader to understand more about your job, read through the documentation related to your team, and also complete the following tasks (to get a hang of how we do stuff here) - write out your first objective and key-result, raise your first leave application (in case you have not done already), raise your first expense, save all the important email IDs to your address book, and also give us feedback on what you liked about the first month, and how we can improve it.</p>
                <p>In this two-week period, you will also get an outline of the tasks that you will work on in the next two months or till the end of the current quarter. Till you complete one full quarter with TDW, you will not be evaluated on any performance metrics, nor are you expected to have OKRs, though you may write out your own OKRs for your clarity and understanding.</p>
                <p>After the end of the first month, for the next two months, you will focus on your work. As the newest member of your team, you will also be required to set up team meetings. The newest three members will be the ones who will take turns in setting up team meetings and driving engagement across the team, based on the inputs from the team leader. You will also be expected to learn the rituals of the team and the organization in these two months.</p>
                <p>You will also have one more important activity to do - you will document all your work and prepare a presentation for your team that you will take in the last week of your first quarter. You will also be asked to make a suggestion that you would like to see implemented in the onboarding process. As we mentioned, an idea never dies at TDW, and its time will come.</p>
                <p>You also will be eligible for 100% of your performance-linked bonus in the first quarterly performance feedback that happens within TDW.</p>
                <p>As we said, we at TDW never have believed in the phrase - hit the ground running. It was either meant for the combat troops deployed at war zones or for vehicles that were used in the erstwhile era. Work is not war. Nor is it love. Work is work. And that is why we want you to have a delightful experience in the first three months.</p>
