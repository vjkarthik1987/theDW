                <p>This chapter is for a host of other important things which do not merit a chapter on their own, but still require that they be mentioned on this site.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Moonlighting</p>
                <p>Moonlighting means any professional, paid job outside your regular job. We believe that it is one of the key pillars that drive entrepreneurship forward. It can range from a music gig on the weekends or a regular job as a coding instructor in the local college. Or it can be even working on your next big business idea.</p>
                <p>In a world, where dual citizenship is not frowned upon, we are OK with moonlighting as long as you take care of the following things</p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li>
                        <p>It does not affect your job in Basecamp and put a break on your outcomes</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It is not with a competitor or with a startup that is building a similar product as a TDW</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It does not involve sharing information/knowledge that is core to the success of TDW</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is a grey area and hence in case you are in doubt, ask your leader or HR, and we will be happy to discuss it. As we always say, we trust you to do the right thing.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Making a mistake</p>
                <p>Mistakes are a part and parcel of every organization’s existence. And we accept and appreciate that. We do not frown upon it.</p>
                <p>In case you make a mistake, do not run away. Own up and move forward. If the mistake is huge and cost us a lot of money, do not run away. Own up and move forward.</p>
                <p>We also have a ‘mistake-box’, a virtual channel where you can shout out the mistake that you made and let everyone in TDW (or your team or your function) know so that they do not make the mistake again. And don’t be surprised if you get a lot of compliments.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Have an idea?</p>
                <p>Ideas are like sparks that have the potential to grow into large fires if they are nurtured well. Many organizations let their ideas fail because they do not capture them at the right time.</p>
                <p>In case you get an idea - a simple one, a wild one, or even a crazy one - log into our idea box on our internal website, and log it. And we will make sure we will discuss the idea within the next three months. It is on us.</p>
                <p>If it is a personal idea, we can still discuss it, and we can guide you on the next steps.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Travel and Expenses</p>
                <p>We do not have an approval policy for our travel. Our travel teams know when you are travelling for TDW’s needs and will book the tickets for you based on your request. As a practice, we do not travel in business class if the travel is less than 4 hours, and even for travel that is more than four hours, some of us do not travel in business class if we feel that the cost is exorbitant. But we leave you to make the best decision. Our travel team will ensure you have a comfortable travel and stay when you travel out.</p>
                <p>We do not have a long approval hierarchy for expenses. Any expense less than $200 is self-approved and any expense greater than $200 is approved by your team leader based on the company norms. If your team leader does not approve the expense in a week, the expense automatically goes for approval to your function leader and will get approved in a week. While we do not ask any questions, we do a post-facto check on the expenses to identify areas where we can rationalize.</p>
                <p>We also want you to have a passport, and get one in case you do not have one.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Our internal systems</p>
                <p>We do have an internal system (some of us call it JaanGo) that does everything from travel requests to expense approvals, and whatnot. Take time to learn it. Trust us. It will be your most trusted friend in TDW.</p>
                <p>We also have a lot of apps (some are inbuilt and some are out-of-the-box products) that we use to work on a day-to-day basis. We will go through them once you are part of TDW.</p>
