                <p>TDW is a workplace that puts you at the centre. And hence, this philosophy and our beliefs dictate how we work.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">How we plan</p>
                <p>Like many organizations, we do not make long-term plans. Yes, we know our focus areas and we have a vision, and yes, some products take a long time to build (read as greater than a year), but we do not plan for the long term. It does not merit the effort. We never bothered about a plan that is more than 3 months long.
                </p>
                <p>One month before the start of a new year, our CEO sends out an email to all of us asking for suggestions on what we need to prioritise for the year ahead on three parameters - people, product, and process. The suggestions can be anything - a new feature, a new people initiative, or building and implementing a new tool that may make development faster. Each of us has a week to respond.
                </p>
                <p>Each suggestion is treated as a pitch and needs to be accompanied by a ‘why I feel it will be useful for TDW’. Yes, we don’t mind making rockets, but it would help our CEO to think through (He is certainly not known for his quick decision making, you know).
                </p>
                <p>All the suggestions are taken into consideration and over the next week, the leadership team gets into a huddle, eats lots of pizzas, considers how we performed over the last year (they also say that they look into market considerations), and comes up with a plan. The literal white smoke. The deadline is Friday. You will have a plan by December 17. This plan will also have a backup for all the chaos that we may witness over the next year. And then all of us are off for our holidays (or those who want to have a holiday can go for a holiday).
                </p>
                <p>Once all of us are back, each team is expected to work within themselves, and between themselves to prepare a plan for the first quarter. These plans need to be in line with TDWs plan, but we do not review the plan for each team. We trust the judgement of the leader. Based on the team plan, each of you will work with your lead to prepare your OKRs (more on this later) for the quarter. Again, we trust you to write down the right OKRs. We will not review it for accuracy or appropriateness. The deadline for all of these is January 15. We know it may get a bit crazy during these few days, but it is worth the effort for the rest of the year.</p>
                <p>As an organization, we expect you to update your OKRs only on a monthly basis (by the 3rd last working day of the month, except the end of every quarter, without fail), but we leave it to the team leads to decide for their teams but if it gets too much, please let us know. On the 2nd last working day, the leadership meets to review the progress for the month, make course corrections for the next month and eat lots of pizza. On the last working day of the month, the progress of the month is presented to all of us and the dashboard is shared on a public repository for each one of us to see.</p>
                <p>At the end of every quarter, on the 4th last working day, you are expected to update the final status of your OKRs. Yes, we know you are going to miss 3 days of progress, but it is OK. Based on the OKRs, our leadership meets for two days (and eats more pizza), takes stock of the item, and decides on the next quarter’s OKRs and the sinister cycle repeats again.</p>
                <p>The annual update is given to us by the leadership on the working day immediately after Janary 15.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">How we exeute</p>
                <p>Key points on how we execute -</p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li>
                        <p>The starting point for any team is the team’s OKRs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Each of the team’s quarterly OKRs is broken down into three sprints - with each month lasting one month. It is easier to keep track of months rather than weeks. Weeks and months don’t gel well together.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The last day of the month is used to reflect and re-energize. We do not make plans for the day unless some serious customer escalations crops up.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Each sprint, ideally should be broken down further so that it is easier to execute and monitor, but we leave it at the discretion of the team lead on how to do that.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When you plan out your OKRs, and break it down into months, plan in such a way that your week consists of three and a half days. We work for only 4 days a week. In case you don’t want to be the unlucky one working on a Friday, keep a buffer. Plans are not made to follow, but are made to serve as a guide.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Give enough time in your plans for your team to learn and rest.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>At the beginning of every month, each team will have a kickoff where the team lead will describe the expected outcomes of the sprint to the team. This has to be documented and put on a public repository for everyone in the organization to see.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>We would love if you send your lead a note every Thursday on ‘What you did this week vis-a-vis what was planned’ and ‘What is the plan for the next week?’. This is strictly optional as of now, but it would be great if you do so - it certainly will help in your quarterly conversations with your lead.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In case you want to pivot during the middle of a sprint - either because you have realized that the objective for this sprint is not relevant anymore, or because the world has changed drastically in the last two weeks - do not hesitate. Shout out, and we will take the appropriate actions if your concern is relevant.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you land upon a new idea during the middle of a sprint, put in the Idea backlog, and we will certainly revisit it as soon as our capacity permits. It may sit on the idea backlog for a while, but it will never die. </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="sub-heading">How we team up</p>
                <p>Ideally, we would like to have a flat organization structure where everyone reports to our CEO, but our CEO is not that bright, and it would not be bright.</p>
                <p>As organizations grow (or should we use the more diplomatic word - scale up), it is important that there is a structure to the teams. Yes, truly flat organizations are present across the world, but at the moment, we are afraid to explore the option.</p>
                <p>But, at the same time, we want to create an organization that is not bogged by too many layers. For that purpose, we have an organization structure that has a maximum of four levels</p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li>
                        <p>Level 1 - The CEO (yeah, he needed a level for himself)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Level 2 - The Function Leaders(aka the people who want to become the next CEO)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Level 3 - The Team Leaders (aka the people who make the tough decisions)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Level 4 - The Individual Contributors (aka the people who actually work)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each person can have a maximum of only 10 people reporting to them. Anything more, and we believe it is a sham. In case you are good at Maths, you would also have observed that in this structure, we can only have a maximum of 1,111 people. Yes, you are right revered one! The moment we grow bigger than that, we will need to retweak the structure - form a separate company, or revisit this 10 to 1 rule. While the latter is easier, it is certainly not our preferred option.</p>
                <p>The CEO is accountable for the entire organization. The Function Leaders are accountable for a set of focused areas - like Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Technology, Governance, Finance etc. The Team Leaders are accountable for a single focused area - like the Sales for a particular region, Mobile development, and so on. The individual contributors are the ones who actually work - like the software engineer, or the digital marketing specialist.</p>
                <p>In a world th only four levels, promotions are difficult. Yeah, kind of, but we will talk about that later.</p>
                <p>We follow a project based approach. Each project is owned by a team leader and is for a duration of at most a quarter. Longer projects have to be mandatorily broken down into smaller phases. At the beginning of every quarter, the team leader can publish the requirements for the project in our internal project portal and hire people internally for the projects based on interests. </p>
                <p>Each individual contributor can join any team he or she wants, as long the following criteria - </p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li>
                        <p>The team leader agrees to the individual contributor joining the project</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The individual contributor has the necessary skills to be part of the project</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The individual contributor has the necessary skills to be part of the project</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>This also means that while an individual contributor has the freedom to join a project that is entirely technical, he or she may not have the requisite skills to join the project and it is important that he or she develops the necessary skills before they can become part of the project.</p>
                <p>We are also an organization that believes in independent work. It means that we want you and your team to be independent as far as possible. In case you are a developer, we also want you to be competent in testing and devops. And in case you are part of a development team, we want you to be self-sufficient team which has all the necessary skills to design, develop, and deploy a new product or add a new feature to an existing product. This also means that we would want you to not wait for someone else to finish a part of your team’s job. Focus on this as you build your team for your project.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Do managers really exist?</p>
                <p>Yes and no - in our world. Yes, because we believe everyone who is part of TDW is a manager - capable enough to manage themselves but not ideal enough or many times, required to manage others. And that is why we do not like the word managers. It is an oft-used over-abused words that is the foundation for many memes.</p>
                <p>We prefer the word leaders. Do a quick google search on the difference between leaders and managers and you will understand. Managers are available in plenty, and leaders are the ones in short supply. And we value that.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">How long do we work?</p>
                <p>In an ideal world, we would want to work only when we feel like. But, we do not live in an ideal world, and hence we have to work. But we understand that there is more to life than just work and hence we follow a four-day work week with Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays being off.</p>
                <p>We dont want to cram in the work for 5 days into 4 days, and hence we recommend a 4 day work with 8 hours on each day. But we don’t track the time you spend and we trust you to give your best shot.</p>
                <p>Let us also accept that there will be situations - because of client escalations, or because of an unexpected leave of absence taken by your colleague - when you will have to stretch beyond normal hours. We hope you understand that such situations cannot be predicted by any one of us and we leave it up to you to do the right thing to make up for the extra effort you are going to put in.</p>
