                <p>TDW is a workplace that puts you at the centre. And hence, this philosophy and our beliefs dictate how we work.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">How we plan</p>
                <p>One month before the start of a new year, our CEO sends out an email to all of us asking for suggestions on what we need to prioritise for the year ahead on three parameters - people, product, and process. The suggestions can be anything - a new feature, a new people initiative, or building and implementing a new tool that may make development faster. Each of us has a week to respond.</p>
                <p>All the suggestions are taken into consideration and over the next week, the leadership team gets into a huddle, eats lots of pizzas, considers how we performed over the last year (they also say that they look into market considerations), and comes up with a plan. The literal white smoke. The deadline is Friday. You will have a plan by December 17. This plan will also have a backup for all the chaos that we may witness over the next year. And then all of us are off for our holidays (or those who want to have a holiday can go for a holiday).</p>
                <p>Once all of us are back, each team is expected to work within themselves, and between themselves to prepare a plan for the first quarter. These plans need to be in line with TDWs plan, but we do not review the plan for each team. We trust the judgement of the leader. Based on the team plan, each of you will work with your lead to prepare your OKRs (more on this later) for the quarter. Again, we trust you to write down the right OKRs. We will not review it for accuracy or appropriateness. The deadline for all of these is January 15. We know it may get a bit crazy during these few days, but it is worth the effort for the rest of the year.</p>
                <p>As an organization, we expect you to update your OKRs only on a monthly basis (by the 3rd last working day of the month, except the end of every quarter, without fail), but we leave it to the team leads to decide for their teams but if it gets too much, please let us know. On the 2nd last working day, the leadership meets to review the progress for the month, make course corrections for the next month and eat lots of pizza. On the last working day of the month, the progress of the month is presented to all of us and the dashboard is shared on a public repository for each one of us to see.</p>
