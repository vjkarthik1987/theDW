                <p>Hiring is one of the core activities that is part of everyoneâ€™s responsibility in TDW. Unlike most organizations where the HR is accountable for hiring, the accountability of hiring a new member into the team is with the leader and the team, and the HR team provides the team with adequate support.</p>
                <p>Let us explain this to you.</p>
                <p>If you want a new member in your team, you and your leader need to agree on the responsibilities and profile for the new hire and share it with the HR team. The HR team will then help you by posting the job in the necessary forums as well as our company websites. You will have to ensure that any profile that we receive as part of this job search is filtered for job fit within two days. You will also have to ensure that you have an interview with the candidate within 7 days of the receipt of the application. And it is on you to ensure that the next subsequent interviews are scheduled within 7 days of the previous interview. Yes, our dear HR will help you with everything, but you, the team leader, are the centre of all of this. You are the driver, and everyone else will ride with you. You own the decision. Once the candidate is hired, you will be the person who will send across the offer letter and also ensure that you have a communication stream with the new hire till he or she joins us. Yeah, yeah - we get it. HR will remind you and help you. But as we always say, we trust you to do your best.</p>
                <p>None of our jobs, except the ones which you require to be physically present in office - such as the office representative, or the server engineer, or similar roles - do not have a location. Some of them have a preferred time zone - such as the support representative for a specific region - but if you are OK making yourself flexible to work according to these timezones, we are OK.</p>
