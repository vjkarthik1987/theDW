                <p>We believe that an employee can work well only if we treat them well. An employee has a multitude of options to choose from and it is our prerogative to make sure that our employees are happy. To make sure our employees are happy, we follow the 5P framework that is used by Microsoft. The same has been given below. We don’t feel ashamed when we copy something. We copy something because it is good.</p>
                <img src="../img/5p.jpg" class="chapter-img" alt="Microsoft 5P Model">
                <p class="sub-heading">So let us start off with pay</p>
                <p>As you start your life with TDW, we offer you a 10% hike from your last job and if you are a fresher, we offer you 10% more than the salary of the freshers at the same roles across a list of companies we have published in our internal website.</p>
                <p>This is the fixed pay - you get it no matter what.</p>
                <p>On top of this, you are eligible to receive a 25% bonus based on your performance. We have already mentioned the measurement methodology in the section about OKRs.</p>
                <p>That is not all - on top of this, you are also eligible to receive a bonus linked to the company's performance. We believe that TDW grows because of you and hence it is our responsibility to share the profits with you. 30% of the earnings before tax and depreciation is uniformly divided amongst all the employees - irrespective of experience, seniority, or location.</p>
                <p>You can also convert a quarter of your performance-based bonus for purchasing stock options at a discounted price. The discounted price and the available number of stock options are reviewed on a quarterly basis and are available on our internal website.</p>
                <p>Our salary increments are rolled out twice a year based on two factors - the inflation rate over the last six months in your geographical location, and the increment based on your performance. These increments are rolled out in April and October.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">So what about the perks</p>
                <p>Our perks are offered based on what we feel can help you out. If you have any suggestions, please do tell your leader or the HR team, and we will certainly look into it. </p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li>
                        <p>You get access to a list of subscriptions - Headspace, Spotify, a gym membership (or any health subscription), Evernote or Todoist, IFTTT, Brainfm, Forest, and Medium. In case you use it, go and claim it - no questions asked.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Team leaders have a budget every quarter to reward performers - our ‘Star’ award. This is a coupon worth $100 that you can use for anything once you receive it.</p>

                    <li>
