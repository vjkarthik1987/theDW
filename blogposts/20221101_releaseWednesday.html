                <p>It is Friday evening. The faces have drooped. Your software engineers have become twitchy. There is a sense of uneasiness and a feeling of impending doom. Anything might happen. The winter is coming. </p>
                <p>Welcome to the world of software engineering. Where plans are made because plans have to be made. And plans are not met because plans are not meant to be met.</p>
                <p>But the world of agile software and agile releases has changed the game. There is a weekly deliverable coming your week. And the week in the traditional sense is from Monday to Friday. Yeah, that is what people think, and that is how they plan.</p>
                <p>And because things invariably get delayed, the code that needs to be checked in on Friday does not get checked in. But the client is going to wait for it on Monday. And then, you cancel your plans for the weekend. You ditch the date with your significant other. You cancel the plans with your kids. You end up sacrificing your social life. You end up becoming a moron.  And you work on the weekends. In fact, it has been found that the queries to product customer care spike after a product release. And a release on Fridays means that people are not available to fix these queries.</p>
                <p>It is common to miss deadlines and end up working overtime. Perfection is a hard thing for humans to attain.</p>
                <p>Weekends are spoilt. Spoilt weekends cause the new weeks to start on a bad note. And the activities planned for the next week take a backseat. And the vicious cycle continues.</p>
                <p>What if the week was not from Monday to Friday, but from Wednesday to Tuesday, with the off days being in the middle? </p>
                <p>This lets people have a break in between when they may, or they may not, think about the progress they make. And it leaves enough room to sort out any bugs or defects that may have crept in. And even if you miss any deadline, it is OK. You have two more days in the week to catch up so that your weekends are not spoilt.</p>
                <p>Moreover, people have been found to be less sharp on Fridays because of the looming weekend. No wonder people tend to let their hair down on Fridays. Thank God It's Fridays.</p>
                <p>In fact, not shipping on a Friday is an unwritten rule in the world of software engineering. Apple ships its releases on a Tuesday, leaving Monday to catch any unwanted bugs and the rest of the week to deploy any changes that may have come because of the releases. And Apple has certainly succeeded in releasing amazing software. Simtech does not release any software on Fridays.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Remember this - if there is a deliverable - either it is a code, or a presentation, or an article - do not commit to giving anything by a Friday. Organizations can help by making their weeks from Wednesday to Tuesday, or from Thursday to Wednesday. It will help employees have a better weekend.</p>
