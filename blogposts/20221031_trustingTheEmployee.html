                <p>In the Austrian capital city of Vienna sits a small restaurant called Der Wiener Deewan, which was established in 2005 and is still going strong.</p>
                <p>Yeah, so what - you may ask. Why did we tell this now? We told you this because it is a successful social experiment where there is no set price for the items on the menu. Customers are allowed to pay what they wish and eat as they like - no compulsions. As the founder, a Pakistani immigrant Afzal Deewan, says, ‘They just decided to trust the customer.’ And the fact that they are still going strong after 17 years shows that the idea has worked. </p>
                <p>And where do we stand when it comes to employees and organizations? Pretty bad actually. We know organizations where a $2 expense will have to go through 2 levels of approval and will take 2 months to get reimbursed. We also know organizations where people are asked to write down their name. </p>
                <p>And at the other end of the spectrum are companies like Netflix and Basecamp. The radical Basecamp has a ‘no-limits’ expense policy. It provides each employee with an American Express credit card in their name to spend on travel, office supplies, and software. Netflix has a travel and expense policy that in summary states - anything is acceptable as long as it is in the best interest of Netflix. U2i, the Polish company, trusts their employees with a company wallet and expects them to do only one thing - spend the money as if it were their own.</p>
                <p>A lot of things that companies do today are because they do not trust their employees - tracking time, installing surveillance software, asking for daily updates, and asking employees to switch on the web camera all the time. Even the push towards a back-to-office movement is also because managers and executive management do not trust people to deliver results by themselves. A sad consequence of management by walking around.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">It is time that organizations start trusting employees a bit more, or in fact, a whole lot more. And then they will get the trust back.</p>
