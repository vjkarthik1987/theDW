            </div>
            <div class="content-holder">
                <p>Before we begin, let us mention that the literal idea of this post may not be completely relevant to those who are in the healthcare industry, or are working in the service industry. But, we would request you to take the core of the idea  - greater flexibility and more time for yourself at the same pay - instead of the literal idea.</p>
                <p>In the olden days (we mean very old when you, me, and our grandfathers were not born), circa around the late 19th century, the lucky ones who had a job were expected to work seven days a week and were asked to clock around 12 to 14 hours a day. Result - a monstrous 100-hour work week. (A bit of history - it was the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/where-the-five-day-workweek-came-from/378870/" target="_blank">Babylonians</a> who invented the concept of a seven-day workweek in honor of their belief that the universe was made of seven planets).</p>
                <p>Then Edison invented the light bulb. JL Baird invented the television. The phone was invented. Movies happened. The Internet became the ‘Fire’ moment for the new generation. Mobile phones came to be a norm.</p>
                <p>And somewhere in between, people began to realize that they could do a lot more than work and come home. People had new wants and desires. And what do workers do when they want they want the management to take note of their dreams and desires - they strike and let the world know. In 1919, a majority of US workers (nearly 4 million) went on a strike to reduce their working hours to 40 at the same pay. They were also inspired by the practice at Ford, which had reduced its working hours from 48 to 40 in 1914. Yeah, a bit of religion also came into the mix. Two of the biggest religious groups in the US at that time had their special days on Saturdays and Sundays - the Jews had their Sabbath on Saturdays, and the Christians had their holy day on Sundays. And as policies happen, it took nearly two decades of back and forth, the then US president Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a policy announcing 40 hours as the standard. </p>
                <p>And time froze. And we all froze along with that. 40 hours became a sacrosanct concept. Not to be debated. Not to be discussed. Not to be changed. It became a fact.</p>
                <p>Today, Americans work the most in the industrialized world, followed by the Japanese. And yet the Europeans are more productive.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">The missed chance for revolution</p>
                <p>In 1933, the US Congress nearly passed a 30-hour workweek bill to cut hours as an alternative to increasing unemployment during the Great Depression, but it failed as opponents called it "communist." And that is how the 40-day workweek was agreed upon. Kellogg’s was a standout. In 1946, after the second world war, workers had voted in favor of a six-hour workday, but the standout was forced to be a part of the crowd as the management gradually shifted towards an eight-hour day over the next few decades.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">But revolts happen when people are suppressed. And it did happen.</p>
                <p>The 21st century brought with it a set of unprecedented changes which also included the rise of digital-age companies and the growth in out-of-the-box thinking by organizations as employees had a lot more options than ever before.</p>
                <p>In 2008, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2009/04/10/102938615/utah-finds-surprising-benefits-in-4-day-workweek#:~:text=Utah%20Finds%20Surprising%20Benefits%20In%204%2DDay%20Workweek%20Utah%20last,to%20productivity%20and%20worker%20satisfaction." target="_blank">Utah</a> government, in a bid to cut down costs shifted to a 4-day workweek. Even though Utah ended the experiment in 2011 because of citizen complaints, they were successful in setting the ball rolling. Iceland, one of the happiest nations in the world, trialed the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57724779" target="_blank">4-day week</a> in 2015 and 2019 and found out that it had benefits that overrode its costs. In New Zealand, trust company Perpetual Guardian announced in February 2018 that it would begin trialing a four-day workweek in March 2018. The six-week trial saw the company's 240-plus staff nominating a day off each week whilst still receiving full pay. The trial, which was tracked and assessed by the University of Auckland Business School and Auckland University of Technology was described as a success. <a href="https://www.perpetualguardian.co.nz/the-four-day-week-is-here/" target="_blank">Perpetual Guardian</a> then extended the four-day workweek scheme permanently. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/04/microsoft-japan-four-day-work-week-productivity" target="_blank">Microsoft Japan</a> conducted a trial four-day workweek in the summer of 2019, granting workers paid leave on Fridays. At the same time, it cut the length of most meetings from a full hour to half an hour and capped attendance at five employees. For the duration of the trial, the company reported a 23% reduction in electricity costs. As of July 2022, more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2022/09/26/four-day-work-week-going-well-in-uk-study-says/?sh=7f2f4b784d76" target="_blank">80 UK companies</a> and organizations are recognized as having permanently implemented a four-day working week of fewer than 35 hours, with most doing fewer than 32 hours. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-24/atom-bank-says-four-day-week-is-the-future-of-working-life" target="_blank">Atom Bank</a>, the world’s first digital bank shifted to a four-day 34-hour work-week as CEO Mark Mullen told the BBC,” I think doing 9-to-5, Monday to Friday, is a pretty old fashioned way of working.” More recently, some of the emirates in the UAE also adopted a four-day workweek. </p>
                <p>Research shows that an average worker who claims to work for nearly eight hours a day is only productive for less than three hours. A lot of them are either reading the news, sipping a cup of coffee, or dreaming about their next holiday. Research also suggests that employees who work four days a week are more productive, happier, and more likely to produce better-quality results.</p>
                <p class="fw-bold">So, why should we work from 9 to 5 from Monday to Friday? Is it not a time for a change? Can Biden be the next FDR? Or can the world’s largest economies be the next Iceland, Britain, or the UAE? Till we have an answer, we can dream.</p>
