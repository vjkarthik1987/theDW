                </ul>
                <p>Let us explain a bit in detail if it flew over your head.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">From Control to Trust & Accountability</p>
                <p>Employees today want to be trusted and be held accountable for their actions and do not believe in the hierarchy of control.</p>
                <p>In the earlier days, managers used to be the kingpins in an employee's career. Right from granting a leave 'request' to approving an expense approval, managers used to have the final word. Organizations used to be designed from top to bottom.</p>
                <p>Today, it is not the case. Right from unlimited vacation days, to a no-question expenses approval policy, employees want to be trusted and want to take on more accountability. They want to be in control. And as a result, organizations are not always designed from the top anymore. Case in point - the organization structure in Spotify.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From time to effort and outcomes</p>
                <p>Many employees today do not be want to be monitored by the time they spent in office or in doing work. They want to be judged by the outcomes they produce, and also expect organizations to consider the effort they put in.</p>
                <p>In earlier days, managers used to look at the timesheet to recognise and reward the best performers. You were a superstar and the favourite of your boss if you came in early and left late. Time was performance. Period.</p>
                <p>Today, with a strong focus on performance management and with the ability to monitor the efforts, the focus is not always on hard work, but also on smart work. Employees want to be rewarded if they are able to deliver the outcomes, even if they don't spend the maximum time in office. Time is not performance anymore, but outcomes and effort form a complex relationship to decide performance.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From Wages to Total Rewards</p>
                <p>Wages are paid based on the number of hours that an employee spends. Rewards are more comprehensive. Today’s employees, even if they work on an hourly basis, prefer a comprehensive reward framework that includes not just a salary, but also bonuses and health coverage instead of being paid by the hour.</p>
                <p>The wages are a by-product of the industrial era where most people used to work from 9 to 5, or in shifts, and collected their money by the end of the day. Time was the king. It is no more the case. Yes, there are jobs which pay by the hour, but the concept of collecting money as wages at the end of the day is slowly going away.</p>
                <p>As rewards get more comprehensive, it is getting virtually impossible to pay just a wage. Even companies which pay salaries on a monthly basis are being forced to adopt a more comprehensive approach as employees are demanding more from their employers. </p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From Rules to Guides</p>
                <p>Employees today hate rules. Why would not they? Humans were never known to follow rules. That is why mythologies were created - to act as guides so that humans never repeated a mistake that their ancestors do. Humans never have felt good when they are compelled by rules, but act surprisingly conscious when the same rules are made as guidelines.</p>
                <p>The organizations of yesteryears were defined by rules. Do not do this. Come to office by 9am. Fill your timesheet. Do not eat in your desk. Yeah, some of them may have been done with good intentions, but hey, rules are rules. And gradually, rules gave way to punishments. Non-conformists were not accepted. ‘Culture-fit’ became the new word for complying to rules. Many organizations today, sadly, are still defined and run by rules. A really sad state of affairs.</p>
                <p>Many companies are changing this. For example, take a look at the handbook of the gaming company Valve. It is not a rulebook, but a guideline. It does not aim to control an employee’s behaviour, but aims to guide it with what can be right or wrong. Rules can be broken, but guidelines cannot be. And normally humans do not tend to.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From Resources to Partners</p>
                <p>Sometime during the industrial era, machines took over. Shop floors became covered with machines. And humans started calling them resources. And resources became the name for anything or anyone that produced an output. Sad, but true. As operations management started taking over organizations, even human beings were called resources. And this practice did not die down even as the knowledge industry started thriving.</p>
                <p>Cue Starbucks. They call their employees as partners. JetBlue dropped the term employees because it did not accurately describe the workforce that made up their team.</p>
                <p>Today, the employees see themselves as partners in an organization journey. Many see their jobs as crafts and consider themselves as masters or experts or even practitioners of their craft. Organizations need to treat them so. Employees are so yesteryear. Make them your partners. Dont just tell them you are building a church. Let them put their names in the bricks they are laying for the church.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From Covert to Overt</p>
                <p>One of the biggest aspects that create a strong bond between employees and their organization is the transparency shown by the organizations towards their employees. Transparency is perceived as trust by employees - it shows them that the organization believes in them to be accountable for the data they share.</p>
                <p>In the earlier days, and even today, many organizations hesitate to share data openly with their employees. They fear that their shortcomings may be shared by the employees across the world. They fear that their employees may run off with the data. They fear a lot of things.</p>
                <p>Yet, the same organizations forget two things - the employees share a lot of their data with you, and they trust you to be accountable for that. It is time that organizations reciprocate. For example, Hubspot is known for being transparent enough to share their entire data with all employees. It is time that organization loosen up and start trusting their employees. Do not penalize the majority for the crimes committed by a few.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From Bonuses and Promotion to Performance, Growth & Mastery</p>
                <p>Today, most employees do not see promotions as an upward journey. And nor do they see bonuses as an annual phenomenon like The Super Bowl. They see growth as a multi-directional journey. They see it as a reward for their performance and mastery of their skills.</p>
                <p>In the earlier days, promotions were given to the ‘supposedly’ best employees - once in three years or twice in a blue moon - either to reward them, or to retain them. Loyalty was the biggest factor.</p>
                <p>Times have changed. Today, bonuses, given more continuously are seen as an immediate reward for good performance. Close a deal - you get a bonus. Get a lead - you get a bonus. And promotions are not just given in one direction. We know people who have become samurai programmers but have resisted the temptation of becoming a team lead or a manager (we hate that word). This is also a result of organizations adopting lesser levels of hierarchy. You cannot go up a lot if there are only three or four levels, right.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From Work-Life to Work and Life</p>
                <p>Today, most employees have accepted the fact that work may not always stop once you are away from your office, or away from your laptop. A smartphone is there. Work has become obtrusive. You take it everywhere, and even to your bathroom.</p>
                <p>But this realization has been misused. Organizations want people to work more and more. Many people have already burned out, or are close to burnout. Organizations, many in fact, do not care. They want you to work more. And you work more because of your inherent fear of missing out, or being thrown out.</p>
                <p>Organizations need to understand that there is something called a personal life, and it is important that it is not intruded upon. Most people work not because they want to work for the organization, but because they want to make money to put food on the table. It is important to let employees have this balance. And this trend is growing. Cue a 4-day workweek or forced sabbaticals. </p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From Rigidity to Agility</p>
                <p>Do you remember the 5-year or 10-year or 20-year plans that your organizations used to draw up? It is time to ditch it. Life is uncertain, and so is growth.</p>
                <p>In the yesteryears, when the world was changing at a slower pace, and fax used to take 5 days to reach the recipient, it was okay to plan for three years, or even for ten years. Now, the world is changing at a faster pace than it just does not make.</p>
                <p>Organizations need to be prepared to be agile, and plan for shorter terms, even if they have a vision for the long-term future.</p>
                
                <p class="sub-heading">From Maximum Shareholder Profit to Optimum Stakeholder Delight</p>
                <p>Biggest Lie - The role of managers is to increase shareholder profit. Employees do not believe this anymore.</p>
                <p>This was the standard rule for managers a few decades ago. Do anything to make sure that the organization is successful. And it has left the world a sadder place. The 2008 economic crisis was a result of this mindset. </p>
                <p>Today, employees including leaders know that an organization is not just made of shareholders but has employees, vendors, regulators, and a whole lot more people. There is the environment and society that the organization  is a part of which is also a big factor. And the goal is not maximizing shareholder profit, but optimizing the profit across the entire stakeholder community. </p>
                
                <p class="fw-bold">These are the ten changes that have happened to the employee’s mindset in the last few decades. Do you want to hear the good news? Some organizations have already taken note of this. The bad news? Many organizations are still stuck in a rut. Which side is your organization on?</p>
